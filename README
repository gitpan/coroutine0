coroutine0 version 0.02
=======================

For the purposes of this module, a coroutine is considered to be a subroutine that
maintains its state and execution position between calls to it.  To return from
a coroutine but start up where you left off, use C<YIELD> instead of C<return> to
send a result back to the caller.

The coroutine declaration syntax leaves much to be desired.  The 0 is suffixed to
the module name so the coroutine module, when it finally appears, will not have
to support this clunky code-in-string-paired-with-BODY-keyword syntax.
